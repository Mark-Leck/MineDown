MineDown is a lightweight GUI front-end watchdog for cgminer, it utilises both the cgminer API & the Twilio SMS API 
and (once configured) will send an SMS Text message to alert you of a problem with your miner.

Simply head on over to www.Twilio.com and sign up for a free Twilio account and then run the MineDown setup to configure the cgminer watchdog.

Any requests, ideas or suggestions then please get in touch!

That's it!

Enjoy!
