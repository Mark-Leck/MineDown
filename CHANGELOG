Version-13022013 - Fixed issue where cgniner start settings were not being saved correctly
Also increased the delay between cgminer start & watchdog start to 60sec from 10sec - this
gives cgminer time to get up & running to full potential and avoids unecessary false alarm triggers.

Standalone installer now added.

Version-12022013 - Fixed some minor bugs affecting new installs when no
configuration files were found.

Version-11022013 - Initial Commit.
