Standalone installer now updated to Version-13022013b

Version-13022013b - cgminer save start settings was still causing issues due to the way $strings were being processed.
I have finally fixed this issue at last! :) I will rebuild the installer again with this script.

Version-13022013 - Fixed issue where cgminer start settings were not being saved correctly
Also increased the delay between cgminer start & watchdog start to 60sec from 10sec - this
gives cgminer time to get up & running to full potential and avoids unecessary false alarm triggers.

Standalone installer now added.

Version-12022013 - Fixed some minor bugs affecting new installs when no
configuration files were found.

Version-11022013 - Initial Commit.
